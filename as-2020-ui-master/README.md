# TPW Simulator 2020
Hi there, this was a quick project I threw together for a work event. It is a game where you are playing someone who is playing cookie clicker.

If you would like to preview it, it is currently alive at tpwsim2020.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/ !

## Goals of the project
This was mainly a bit of fun to try out using React. I learn that React is really cool and I love it! I was also experimenting with an idea for animations-as-functions which I might expand into a library.
